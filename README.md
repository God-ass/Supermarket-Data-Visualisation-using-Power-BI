# Supermarket-Data-Visualisation-using-Power-BI

Objective: The objective of this project is to create a data visualization using Power BI to analyze and gain insights from a supermarket dataset.

Methodology: 
1. Data Cleaning: The first step in this project is to clean the supermarket dataset. This involves removing any missing or incorrect data, and ensuring that the data is in a format that can be easily analyzed.
2. Data Visualization: Once the data has been cleaned, it will be imported into Power BI. Various visualizations will be created to analyze the data and gain insights. These visualizations may include charts, graphs, and tables.

Expected Outcome: The expected outcome of this project is a comprehensive data visualization that provides insights into the supermarket dataset. This visualization will be created using Power BI and will be based on the cleaned data.
